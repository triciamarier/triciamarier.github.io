## Team Accomplishments

In this project, I worked a lot on improving the... 

This project taught me a lot about working as a group and having to come up with our own improvements and solutions in order to make the existing project and algorithm better. It also involved a lot of self-driven work and research, and at some points I did feel lost and stuck and felt like I needed to be given direction. I would say it felt a bit like a job as the professor doesn't set up everything for you or give you instructions on how to do it. Through this team, I was able to learn a lot about the process of creating something from the research to the design, as well as having to plan out a timeline for your team on how and when we would get the job done.
