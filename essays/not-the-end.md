At the start of my final year in college, I began thinking more seriously of what I would do once I graduated. With some hesitation, I would say I was not entirely sure as there are so many choices and decisions that I felt I needed to make. Not having a plan is scary. I then took ICS314, a software engineering class. I never expected to learn things in this course that could be applied in places beyond web application development.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are a solution to a problem that occurs commonly and can be used in multiple situations. At first I thought design patterns are pretty complex, but learning it with reference to what I have been learning about and doing myself recently has allowed me to understand the various design patterns more easily. I am glad I was able to learn about design patterns because if I was ever asked about a question relating to design patterns before, the interviewer would probably know that I don't know what I am talking about. I think design patterns can be applied beyond web application in simple fixes and todos to help people solve problems that can occur. There will never be a stop to the creation of new design patterns and so hopefully after putting in enough work, effort, and challenges, I to will be able to discover a new design pattern to help make life more easier for everyone.

## Agile Project Management

Before taking this class, collaborating as a team was pretty difficult, especially when it involved multiple files with a large amount of code and no assignment to who does what. I was happy to learn about Agile Project Management. This involved tools and tricks to collaborate within a team more efficiently by breaking the project up into milestones, and having issues assigned within each milestone for each member in the group through Github. Through this, I was able to keep track of what was getting done. In addition to this, I believe planning is an important skill and setting up due dates for yourself and the team to stay on track and avoid procrastination. 

## Conclusion

I have learned a lot of things throughout this year, but a great lesson I learned is that learning never ends even once I graduate from college. There are always new things to see, new patterns to create, and smart questions to be made. In the midst of challenges and difficulties that I faced in my classes and in life, I am thankful for all that I have learned and hope to take it with me along the way.
