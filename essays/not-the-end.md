At the start of my final year in college, I began thinking more seriously of what I would do once I graduated. With some hesitation, I would say I was not entirely sure as there are so many choices and decisions that I felt I needed to make. Not having a plan is scary. I then took ICS314, a software engineering class. I never expected to learn things in this course that could be applied in places beyond web application development.

## Design Patterns
Design Patterns are much more complex than I originally thought, but learning it with reference to what I have been learning about and doing myself recently has allowed me to understand the various design patterns more easily. I am glad I was able to learn about design patterns because if I was ever asked about a question relating to design patterns before, the interviewer would probably know that I don't know what I am talking about. Maybe one day after putting enough work and effort, I to will be able to discover a new design pattern.

## Agile Project Management

Learn to collaborate more efficiently in a team by breaking a project into sequence of milestones, and each milestone into issues which are assigned to group members and tracked in GitHub.

## Conclusion

I have learned a lot of things throughout this year, but a great lesson I learned is that learning never ends even once I graduate from college. There are always new things to see, new patterns to create, and smart questions to be made. In the midst of challenges and difficulties that I faced in my classes and in life, I am thankful for all that I have learned and hope to take it with me along the way.
