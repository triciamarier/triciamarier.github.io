For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

At the start of my final year in college, I began thinking more seriously of what I would do once I graduated. With some hesitation, I would say I was not entirely sure as there are so many choices and decisions that I felt I needed to make. Not having a plan is scary. I then took ICS314, a software engineering class. I never expected to learn things in this course that could be applied in places beyond web application development.

Design Patterns are much more complex than I originally thought, but learning it with reference to what I have been learning about and doing myself recently has allowed me to understand the various design patterns more easily. I am glad I was able to learn about design patterns because if I was ever asked about a question relating to design patterns before, the interviewer would probably know that I don't know what I am talking about. Maybe one day after putting enough work and effort, I to will be able to discover a new design pattern. Maybe even one that can solve all of life's problems.

Learn to collaborate more efficiently in a team by breaking a project into sequence of milestones, and each milestone into issues which are assigned to group members and tracked in GitHub.

## Conclusion

Despite having difficulty myself asking people for help, I think the practice of asking smart questions is good and beneficial. Along with receiving smart answers, we should be thankful to the people who are willing to answer them so it is best to help them by being specific, informative, and smart when stating our questions. Smart questions will get smart answers, so I shouldn't be afraid of asking for help when I need it as long as I ask the smart way.
