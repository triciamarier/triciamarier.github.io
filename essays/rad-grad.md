## My Thoughts on RadGrad

**RadGrad** is a site for computer science and computer engineering students focused on helping them navigate through their college career and find courses, opportunities, and activities that fit their interests and career goals.

RadGrad is a really nice site where you can find various courses and opportunities based on your interests. It showed me many new interests related to computer science that I didn't know about before. I liked how when I chose an opportunity it also showed me related courses, interests, and career goals. Through it I was able to find many opportunities that I haven't heard about before. What I enjoyed most about this site is the Career Goals page where there's descriptions and videos of various careers in the software field. I believe it will definitely help me in finding a job that I am interested in.

I feel that RadGrad is not used enough to network and communicate with other people, but rather a site to find different resources and opportunities. I wish that there would have been more information on available internships as when I looked on that page, there was nothing there. It was also tough to have to create my "course plan" because I'm already a senior so having to put many opportunities in a span of two semesters seemed kind of pointless, but I guess doing so also gave me an idea of possible experiences I can take even if I won't participate in all of them.

## Conclusion
I had a good experience using RadGrad and I think its important to start using it when you start of your college career in the field of technology. Now that I am about to graduate, there were a lot of experiences that I wish I knew about through using RadGrad that I was unaware of before. There are a few technical things that I think should be upgraded or changed, but overall it is a good site to look for new software opportunities and to learn more about what your interests are and maybe even find some new ones.
