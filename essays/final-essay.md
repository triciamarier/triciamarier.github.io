* Configuration Management
* Coding Standards
* Agile Project Management

For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

At the start of my final year in college, I began thinking more seriously of what I would do once I graduated. With some hesitation, I would say I was not entirely sure there are so many choices and decisions that I felt I needed to make and to not have a plan felt scary. I then took ICS314 course, a software engineering class. I never expected to learn things in this course that could be applied to things beyond web application development.

## Conclusion

Despite having difficulty myself asking people for help, I think the practice of asking smart questions is good and beneficial. Along with receiving smart answers, we should be thankful to the people who are willing to answer them so it is best to help them by being specific, informative, and smart when stating our questions. Smart questions will get smart answers, so I shouldn't be afraid of asking for help when I need it as long as I ask the smart way.
