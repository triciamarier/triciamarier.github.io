## My Experience with UI Frameworks

Recently, I learned for the first time ever about the basics of user interface design using HTML and CSS. During that time, I struggled a lot with the many new definitions, syntax, and tools that I was not at all familiar with and wondered how long and it would take to build a visually aesthetic webpage. Now, I suddenly came into contact with Semantic UI. Semantic UI is a UI framework that makes it even easier and faster to create those aesthetics that I once thought would take months to complete and design on my own. It has been good to be able to use Semantic UI, but it also feels like there are a million more tools and definitions that I need to learn and adjust to.

Semantic UI has solved a lot of small problems and struggles I faced while using simple HTML calls. However, Semantic UI has been a little bit difficult and is gonna take a lot of practice for me to become accustomed to using it. In one of my first projects, I was able to design a webpage of my choice and I found a lot of problems with adjusting the margins because of the set containers. There were also instances where I would edit a class in my CSS file to change a font color, size, or spacing and it wouldn't work, but of course, a quick fix to that would be to use "!important". Sadly, it feels like I've been just doing whatever I can to make the website look how I want it to, and often there is no rule or method as to how I am fixing it making it more difficult to create a set system to how I am creating my page.

## My Creation

<div class="ui medium images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/strangers.png">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/strangers2.png">
</div>

Using Semantic UI, I was able to make my re-creation, as shown above, of a site called We're Not Really Strangers. Some things that came in handy were the UI container and menu, classes that are a part of Semantic UI. These classes made the spacing of the elements in the menu bar easily aligned and also allows us to group them into columns and rows of equal size. I also used other different classes such as labels, buttons, icons, and grids from Semantic UI. Since they were pre-built and defined, I just needed to call those classes and adjust the style to my liking as I can change the colors, size, or position of it.

## Conclusion 

Once familiar with the use of Semantic UI and its many elements, classes, and rules, it will be worth it as it makes designing a webpage easier. Using raw HTML and CSS may be simple and have fewer items to remember, but it will take a lot more to write using simple HTML when building more complicated websites than it would if the time is taken to understand and remember the various features and tools of Semantic UI.
