The first thing that came to mind when I heard the word design patterns in relation to Software Engineering is the style of your code and a set design you use in order to solve problems. Upon reading and researching more about it I realized it was much more than that. I was met with words such as Singleton, MVC, Observer, and others that felt very foreign and high-level to me. So what are design patterns?

If I could explain it in a simpler way, it would be breaking something and someone offering the solution to "Just put it in rice" or "Try turning it off and on." All jokes aside, although these solutions may sometimes work, it is much more than this, and it offers a much better solution than putting it in rice. Design patterns are a solution to a problem that occurs commonly and can be used in multiple situations.

Before this week, if an interviewer would ever ask me "What design patterns have you used in your own code?", I would think none in particular. It's weird to think that in these past few months I've been using design patterns without even knowing what they were.

A design pattern that I have used is the Observer through the publish-subscribe model in the data flow of Meteor where we use publishers and subscriptions to be able to subscribe to publications and use that to access data in our collections. Another example is reactive data which I have used in creating event handlers to handle reactive elements such as clicking a button to perform an action. Model-View-Controller is another design pattern I have used where we use Mongo collections as the model, view through React where we create various pages and render them to be viewed on a site, and controller in which Meteor is used to render the startup of an application and other various functions within an app. I have used Singleton in creating various classes of collections through MongoDB collections that is exported then invoked by the client to add data to these collections.

## Conclusion

Design Patterns are much more complex than I originally thought, but learning it with reference to what I have been learning about and doing myself recently has allowed me to understand the various design patterns more easily. I am glad I was able to learn about design patterns because if I was ever asked about a question relating to design patterns before, the interviewer would probably know that I don't know what I am talking about. Maybe one day after putting enough work and effort, I to will be able to discover a new design pattern. Maybe even one that can solve all of life's problems.
